If your personal information is no longer required for this purpose, we will delete it or make it anonymous by removing all details that identify you.</p>
                  <p>However, if necessary, we may retain your personal information for our compliance with a legal, accounting, or reporting obligation or for archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific, or historical research purposes or statistical purposes.</p>
